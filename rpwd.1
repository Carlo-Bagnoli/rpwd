rpwd \- [R]andom [P]ass[W]or[D] generator \f[B]WARNING:\f[R] This piece
of software was developed in python, so it\[cq]s not extremely
efficient, although it is pretty secure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]rpwd\f[R] [\f[I]ARGUMENTS\f[R]] [\f[I]FLAGS\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]rpwd\f[R] creates a list of pseudo\-random passwords which you can
manipulate to your needs.
It has 2 lists, one made of normal characters and one made of
miscellaneous characters.
There is a ratio of the amount of characters from each list that will be
mixed in the list, the default is 1/4, so if there\[cq]s the length is
32 then the amount of special characters is going to be 8.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.B \f[B]\-t\f[R] [integer]
[times] Specify the number of passwords to print.
.TP
.B \f[B]\-l\f[R] [integer]
[lenght] Specify the lenght of each password.
.TP
.B \f[B]\-r\f[R] [integer]
[ratio] \f[B]WARNING\f[R] the ratio is NOT an float, it\[cq]s an
integer, it represents the inverse of the actual ratio, so if the ratio
is \[lq]4\[rq] then the \f[B]actual\f[R] ratio is 0.25, because it\[cq]s
1/4.
.TP
.B \f[B]\[en]special\-appearances\f[R] [integer]
[Number of special characters in each password] If you want to specify
the amount of special characters in each password, then use this
argument followed by an integer to do so.
.TP
.B \f[B]\[en]remove\f[R] [string]
[Remove characters that you don\[cq]t want] If you don\[cq]t wan\[cq]t
some characters, then write the characters in single quotes.
e.g: `[IMAGE: image ()]'.
If you want to remove characters that conflict with single quotes [e.g:
[ or \[cq]] then write the escape code of the character, like so: \[rs][
\[rs]\[cq] \f[B]Tip\f[R]: If you want to see all special characters then
run: rpwd \[en]list\-all\-special
.SH FLAGS
.TP
.B \f[B]\-H\f[R]
[Hide] Hide all special characters.
